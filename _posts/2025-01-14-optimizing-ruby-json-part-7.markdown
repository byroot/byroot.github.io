In [the previous post](/ruby/json/2025/01/12/optimizing-ruby-json-part-6.html), we started covering some parser optimizations.
There's just a handful more to cover until we reached what's the state of the currently released version of `ruby/json`.

## Batch APIs

But as always, let's start with a flame graph of `twitter.json`, to see what was left to optimize:

![](/assets/articles/json-7/flamegraph-twitter.png)

[Full profile](https://share.firefox.dev/4gRJXjb).

Something that was bothering me in that profile, was the whopping `26.6%` of time spent in `rb_hash_aset`,
which is the C API for `Hash#[]=`.

It wasn't really surprising to me though. I'm sure you've heard about some super fast JSON parsers like `simdjson`, `rapidJSON` etc,
Some of you may have wondered why I didn't just do a binding of one of these to make `ruby/json` faster.
Aside from many technical and legal restrictions, a big reason is that actually parsing JSON isn't that much of a bottleneck,
even the fairly naive Ragel parser in `ruby/json` isn't that slow (It could be way better though, but more on that later).

No, the really expansive part is building the Ruby objects tree, as evidenced by the time spent in `rb_hash_aset` on that
flame graph, but also in `rb_ary_push` on benchmarks that use a lot of arrays. So a custom parser can potentially end up faster
overall by being better tailored to make efficient use of Ruby APIs, such as how we do unescaping inside Ruby strings to avoid
extra copies and cache string keys.

But let's focus on that part of the flame graph to see why `rb_hash_aset` is slow, and what we could do about it:

![](/assets/articles/json-7/flamegraph-hash-aset.png)

I want to draw your attention to two things in this flame graph.

The first is `ar_force_convert_table` on the left. You may have noticed that many functions in the graphs are prefixed with
`st_` or `rb_st` and a few with `ar_`.

The `st_` ones are referring to [`st.c`, Ruby's internal Hash Table implementation](https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/23fc0fc22d0f066938387f3397fb8ee9358744e5/st.c).
What the `st` name stands for however I don't know. `st.c` is a relatively well-optimized hash table that evolved over the years,
which is to be expected given how much Ruby relies on hash tables, even a modest performance gain in that data structure can have a
big impact overall. You can read its preamble if you want more details.

As for `ar_`, which I believe stands for "array", refers to an optimization Ruby hashes do under the hood.
Hash tables are great, and offer a good access performance when the dataset is large, but when it's very small they use quite a
lot of memory and aren't really any better than a linear search. And Ruby code uses a lot of very small hash tables.

So Ruby hashes have an internal limit, [`RHASH_AR_TABLE_MAX_SIZE`](https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/23fc0fc22d0f066938387f3397fb8ee9358744e5/internal/hash.h#L17C9-L17C32),
which on 64-bit platforms is `8`. Any Ruby Hash that contains `8` or fewer entries is actually lying to you, and is just an array
in a trenchcoat. That's what `ar_table` is, a simple array of key and value pairs being used as an associative array.
And yes, its algorithmic complexity is technically `O(n)`, but with such a small `n`, it often is faster than doing all the hashing.

And if you add enough items in a Hash backed by an `ar_table`, it will be converted automatically to a `st_table`. That's what
the `ar_force_convert_table` function does.

You can somewhat see this using one of my favorite APIs, `ObjectSpace.dump`:

{% highlight ruby %}
>> require "objspace"
>> puts ObjectSpace.dump(8.times.to_h { |i| [i, i] })
{"address":"0xf3d8", "type":"HASH", "slot_size":160, "size":8, "memsize":160, ...}
{% endhighlight %}

This tells us a Hash with 8 keys fits neatly in a 160B object slot. Each object reference is 8B, 2 references per entry,
`16 * 8 => 128`, so with a few extra metadata and perhaps a bit of wasted space, it checks out.

But if we do the same with a Hash with `9` items, the result is very different:

{% highlight ruby %}
>> puts ObjectSpace.dump(9.times.to_h { |i| [i, i] })
{"address":"0x1230", "type":"HASH", "slot_size":160, "size":9, "memsize":544, ...}
{% endhighlight %}

`544B`, that's a big jump, but not so surprising. Hash tables almost by definition need to be somewhat large to not collide too much.

The other function on the flame graph I'd like to point out is `rebuild_table_if_necessary`, which stems from the same concern,
when you append to a Hash table, and it starts to get a bit too full, you have to increase its size, and contrary to an array,
it's not just a matter of calling `realloc`, you have to essentially allocate a larger table, and then re-insert all the pairs
which means hashing the keys again, and that's costly.

The problem though, is that exactly what we're doing. When we encounter the start of a JSON object (`{`), we allocate a Ruby
Hash with `rb_hash_new`, and then every time we're done parsing a key-value pair, we call `rb_hash_aset` to append to the hash.

So if a JSON document contains an object with 30 keys, we first allocate an `ar_table` with a capacity of `8` pairs, get it rebuilt
as a `st_table` that can hold `16` entries, and finally a third time with `32` entries. Meaning we're hashing every key 3 times,
and wasting time in `malloc` and `free`.

When parsing a format like `msgpack`, or Ruby's Marshal, the byte that signals the start of a Hash is followed by the expected
size of the Hash, allowing you to pre-allocate it with the right size, which helps a lot.
But JSON doesn't have that, we have no choice but to parse as we go, and we'll only know how big the Hash is once we're done
parsing it.

The problem is the same with large arrays, they start embedded, and then double in size every time they run out of space, it's just
not quite as bad because at least we don't hash to re-hash the keys.

But looking at the flame graph above, we can see that all this resizing is a majority of the time spent in `rb_hash_aset`, and
`rb_hash_aset` over a quarter of the overall time, so there was really a big opportunity here.

If it's a bad idea to directly append to a Hash before we know how large it will be, why don't we just wait to be done parsing it
before we build it? Basic.

But that means we need to store its content somewhere else in the meantime, and the ideal structure for that is a stack, which 
is just a fancy name for an array.

You can look at [the full patch in C](https://github.com/ruby/json/pull/678), but I'll try to explain the key concept with some
Ruby code here.

Before the parsing code was something like this:

{% highlight ruby %}
def parse_object
  hash = {}
  until object_done?
    key = parse_object_key
    value = parse_json
    hash[key] = value
  end
  hash
end
{% endhighlight %}

We simply parse until we find the object terminator, and until then we append to the Hash whenever we get a complete pair,
and each parsing function simply returns the parsed object.

After the change it now looks more something like this:

{% highlight ruby %}
def parse_object(stack)
  previous_size = stack.size
  until object_done?
    stack << parse_object_key
    stack << parse_json
  end
  hash = stack.pop(stack.size - previous_size).to_h
  stack << hash
  hash
end
{% endhighlight %}

Every parse function now receives an array to use as the parsing stack, whatever they parse, they push on the stack.
The `parse_object` function is no exception, it first records how large the stack is, then it parses keys and values
and push them both on the stack.
Once the end of the object is found, all the pairs are popped from the back of the stack, and a hash is immediately created with
the right size, ensuring each key is only hashed once.

In C, it looks like this:

{% highlight c %}
    long count = json->stack->head - stack_head;

    VALUE hash;
#ifdef HAVE_RB_HASH_NEW_CAPA
    hash = rb_hash_new_capa(count >> 1);
#else
    hash = rb_hash_new();
#endif
    rb_hash_bulk_insert(count, rvalue_stack_peek(json->stack, count), hash);
    *result = hash;
    rvalue_stack_pop(json->stack, count);
{% endhighlight %}

You should be able to recognize the pattern, we create a hash of the right size using the `rb_hash_new_capa` API,
which unfortunately we have to test for its existence because unfortunately [I only exposed it to C extensions a few years ago](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/18683).
Then we insert all pairs at once with `rb_hash_bulk_insert`.

And that's it, with just that change, the `twitter.json` benchmark was sped up by `22%`:

## Avoid Double Scanning

After the value stack patch was so effective, `json_string_unescape` was back to being the biggest bottleneck at `22%` of total runtime:

![](/assets/articles/json-7/flamegraph-str-unescape.png)

[Full profile](https://share.firefox.dev/4hfnvjD).

I had recently optimized it by optimistically assuming most strings don't contain any escape character, but something still\
bothered me. The Ragel parser calls our `JSON_parse_string` callback with both the start and end pointer of the string, to do
that it has to scan the string, so it's a bit silly that the first thing we immediately do right after that is to scan it all over
again.

It would be way better if while it is looking for the end of the string, the Ragel parser would record if it had seen any
backslash, and if not, we'd save on re-scanning it again.

Here's how the JSON strings grammar was defined:

{% highlight c %}
%%{
    machine JSON_string;
    include JSON_common;

    write data;

    action parse_string {
        *result = json_string_unescape(json, json->memo + 1, p, json->parsing_name, json->parsing_name || json-> freeze, json->parsing_name && json->symbolize_names);
        if (NIL_P(*result)) {
            fhold;
            fbreak;
        } else {
            fexec p + 1;
        }
    }

    action exit { fhold; fbreak; }

    main := '"' ((^([\"\\] | 0..0x1f) | '\\'[\"\\/bfnrt] | '\\u'[0-9a-fA-F]{4} | '\\'^([\"\\/bfnrtu]|0..0x1f))* %parse_string) '"' @exit;
}%%
{% endhighlight %}

If you don't understand it, don't worry, me neither.

That's where I kinda need to confess that I don't have a proper computer science education, more some sort of very applied
software engineering curriculum, and not a particularly good one, so terms like "formal grammar" and parser generators like Ragel
et al kind of fly over my head, hence I'm kinda struggling to improve the core parsing parts. And I also can't rely on
my usual tricks to work with things I don't fully grasp because Ragel outputs absolutely disgusting code with lots of `goto`,
which makes it super hard to learn by experimentation.

Yet, even with my limited understanding, I can say something is really off here.
We can see on the last line that we're basically instructing Ragel about all the possible escape sequences inside a JSON string,
which to me doesn't make much sense. All we need the parser to do for us is to know enough to find the end of the string, 
tell us it ran into the end of the stream without finding it, or if it ran into an invalid character (e.g. a newline).

It absolutely doesn't need to validate that `\u` is followed by 4 hexadecimal characters, we can do that during unescaping.

But anyway, this is for strings with escape sequences, and we don't have that many of those, I had to figure out a way
to have a fast path for simple strings, and after a few hours of struggling and begging some properly educated people for help
I managed to get this:

{% highlight c %}
%%{
    machine JSON_string;
    include JSON_common;

    write data;

    action parse_complex_string {
        *result = json_string_unescape(json, json->memo + 1, p, json->parsing_name, json->parsing_name || json-> freeze, json->parsing_name && json->symbolize_names);
        fexec p + 1;
        fhold;
        fbreak;
    }

    action parse_simple_string {
        *result = json_string_fastpath(json, json->memo + 1, p, json->parsing_name, json->parsing_name || json-> freeze, json->parsing_name && json->symbolize_names);
        fexec p + 1;
        fhold;
        fbreak;
    }

    double_quote = '"';
    escape = '\\';
    control = 0..0x1f;
    simple = any - escape - double_quote - control;

    main := double_quote (
         (simple*)(
            (double_quote) @parse_simple_string |
            ((^([\"\\] | control) | escape[\"\\/bfnrt] | '\\u'[0-9a-fA-F]{4} | escape^([\"\\/bfnrtu]|0..0x1f))* double_quote) @parse_complex_string
         )
    );
}%%
{% endhighlight %}

The idea is simple, start by only looking for a double quote not preceded by any backslash, that's the optimistic path, and if it
matches we enter `parse_simple_string`. If it doesn't, we fall back to the previous pattern and end up in `parse_complex_string`.

The fast path is a much simpler function:

{% highlight c %}
static VALUE json_string_fastpath(JSON_Parser *json, char *string, char *stringEnd, bool is_name, bool intern, bool symbolize)
{
    size_t bufferSize = stringEnd - string;

    if (is_name) {
        VALUE cached_key;
        if (RB_UNLIKELY(symbolize)) {
            cached_key = rsymbol_cache_fetch(&json->name_cache, string, bufferSize);
        } else {
            cached_key = rstring_cache_fetch(&json->name_cache, string, bufferSize);
        }

        if (RB_LIKELY(cached_key)) {
            return cached_key;
        }
    }

    return build_string(string, stringEnd, intern, symbolize);
}
{% endhighlight %}

Nothing particularly fancy. Unfortunately the impact on `twitter.json` wasn't that big:

```

               after:      913.7 i/s - 1.03x  faster
```

I was a bit disappointed, but still, I progressed a bit in my understanding of Ragel and knew there was
lots of fishy things in `ruby/json`'s Ragel parser, so that would be useful.

## Avoid Useless Copies

After that disappointment, I needed a bit of a break, so I went back to a function where I knew I could get better
results on, integer parsing.

I didn't have a micro-benchmark dedicated to integers, but the small array one would do:

{% highlight ruby %}
benchmark_parsing "small nested array", JSON.dump([[1,2,3,4,5]]*10)
{% endhighlight %}

So 10 arrays, with 5 integers each, quite simple.

And you know the drill, it started with some profiling.

![](/assets/articles/json-7/flamegraph-integer.png)

[Full profile](https://share.firefox.dev/4jeyFXA).

As [we mentioned in the previous part](/ruby/json/2025/01/12/optimizing-ruby-json-part-6.html#more-stack-allocation),
`rb_cstr2inum`, the API Ruby gives us to turn a C string into a Ruby Integer, isn't very efficient.

First, because it expects a C string, it forces us to first copy the string into a buffer so we can append a `NULL` to it,
but also because it has to deal with quite a lot of cases we don't care about, such as a variable base. For instance `0xff` is a
valid number for `rb_cstr2inum`, but not for JSON. It also has to support arbitrary long integers, which slows it down, but the
overwhelming majority of the numbers we parse fit in 64 bits.

So we have an opportunity here for another fast path type of function, that would deal with the crux of integer parsing, and
for the rare and complex cases, continue to rely on `rb_cstr2inum`.

The implementation is very straightforward, you can see [the full patch](https://github.com/ruby/json/pull/692),
but I'll detail the key parts:

{% highlight c %}
static inline VALUE fast_parse_integer(char *p, char *pe)
{
    bool negative = false;
    if (*p == '-') {
        negative = true;
        p++;
    }

    long long memo = 0;
    while (p < pe) {
        memo *= 10;
        memo += *p - '0';
        p++;
    }

    if (negative) {
        memo = -memo;
    }
    return LL2NUM(memo);
}
{% endhighlight %}

We start by checking if the number is negative, then convert ASCII characters into the corresponding integer one by one.

The limitation, however, is that this can only work for an integer that fits in a native integer type, as such we only enter
this fast path if the number of digits is low enough:

{% highlight c %}
#define MAX_FAST_INTEGER_SIZE 18

long len = p - json->memo;
if (RB_LIKELY(len < MAX_FAST_INTEGER_SIZE)) {
    *result = fast_parse_integer(json->memo, p);
} else {
    fbuffer_clear(&json->fbuffer);
    fbuffer_append(&json->fbuffer, json->memo, len);
    fbuffer_append_char(&json->fbuffer, '\0');
    *result = rb_cstr2inum(FBUFFER_PTR(&json->fbuffer), 10);
}
{% endhighlight %}

Why 18? Because regardless of the CPU architecture, [in C a `long long` must support a maximum value of `9,223,372,036,854,775,807`
and a minimum value of `â9,223,372,036,854,775,808`](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/C_Programming/limits.h#Member_constants), in other words, it's always a 64-bit integer.
That's 19 digits, but there are some 19-digit numbers that don't fit in a `long long`, so 18.

It would be possible to handle slightly bigger numbers by using an `unsigned long long`, but I didn't think it was worth it.

As for the impact on the micro-benchmark, it was pretty good:

## Avoid Duplicated Work

The final parser optimization that shipped with `json 2.9.0`, was submitted by [Aaron Patterson](https://github.com/tenderlove).
I'm not too sure how he got to work on it, perhaps he was attracted by the smell of blood when he saw me cursing
against Ragel in our company Slack, who knows?

The key element of Aaron's patch is that he changed this:

{% highlight c %}
np = JSON_parse_float(json, fpc, pe, result);
if (np != NULL) {
    fexec np;
}
np = JSON_parse_integer(json, fpc, pe, result);
{% endhighlight %}

Into this:

{% highlight c %}
np = JSON_parse_number(json, fpc, pe, result);
{% endhighlight %}

If it's not yet obvious, the previous version of the parser would first try to parse a float, and if it failed to do so,
would try to parse an integer. This is quite wasteful, because all floats start with an integer, so whenever the next value to
parse was an integer, it would first be fully scanned by `JSON_parse_float` to figure out it's not an integer, and then the parser
would backtrack and scan the same bytes again in `JSON_parse_integer`.

You can look at [the full patch](https://github.com/ruby/json/pull/698/), which also contains some changes to the grammar and
state machine to make the above change possible, but that really is the core of it.

And you might think it's indeed more efficient, but probably not that big of a deal in the grand scheme of things, but actually
it did speedup `twitter.json` and `citm_catalog.json` by a nice `5%`:

```

```

## Fin?

And that's it, that was the final optimization performed before I released `json 2.9.0`, so I will conclude this series.

If you wonder how fast it now is, here's a final `twitter.json` benchmark against the competition:

That isn't to say I'm done optimizing, I have quite a few ideas for the future, but I wanted to stabilize the gem prior to the
release of Ruby 3.4.0, and I feel it is now fast enough that there's no urgency.

But to give you an idea of what may happen in the future, I'd like to drop Ragel and replace it with a simpler recursive descent
parser. The existing one could certainly be improved, but I find it much harder to work with generated parsers than to write them
manually.

I'm also currently pairing with [Ãtienne BarriÃ©](https://github.com/etiennebarrie) on [a better API for both the parser and the encoder](https://github.com/ruby/json/pull/718)
which would allow to reduce the setup cost even further, stop relying as much on global state, and would generally be more ergonomic.

I hope you enjoyed this blog series, I'll try to continue writing, next, I'd like to share some thoughts on [Pitchfork](https://github.com/Shopify/pitchfork),
but I may need to set the stage for it with other posts to explain some key concepts.
